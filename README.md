# Marketing-Analytics
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions. It is a powerful tool for identifying your best customers and understanding their behavior, so that you can target them with more relevant marketing campaigns.

The RFM acronym stands for:

Recency: How recently did the customer make a purchase?
Frequency: How often does the customer make purchases?
Monetary value: How much money does the customer spend?
